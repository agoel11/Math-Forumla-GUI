# Math-Forumla-GUI
This is a GUI that can help you see any math formula you want, and see how it is used.

You can simply type, or click the formula you want and hit search

An image will come up of the actual formula

Once you click the searchbar again the image dissappears and you can start over

This is a prototype and our ultimate goal is to make this a website or a chrome extension with many more formulas

*The icon of the GUI is also a Codeday logo if you look closely ;)*

Clickling a formula autofills it^^

Typing has a auto-fill feauture which only shows searches with the typed characters in it^^

Click the searchbar to restart^^

The colors and dimensions of the GUI can be adjusted as needed

The code is not machine specific (MAC, Linux, or Windows)

There are some ares where you must specify the path to the images on your machine, but that can be changed easily

The .ico file is the image for the icon that is displyed

The formulas folder has all the images for the formulas

The images are padded to be the same size 965x625

Enjoy!
